        <p>
            A front-end developer on a mission to make the web a more enchanting place. <br> <br>

            With 5 years of navigating the coding cosmos, I've transformed coffee-fueled ideas into dazzling digital experiences. <b class="text-[#1C89FA] font-[600]">I don't just write code; I compose symphonies of pixels that dance and sing on the screen.</b>  User interfaces aren't just interfaces to me; they're canvases waiting for an artistic touch. <br> <br>

            What fuels my code engine? <b class="text-red-400 font-[600]">Passion, curiosity, and an insatiable appetite for innovation.</b> I believe in pushing boundaries, experimenting with the latest tech trends, and turning challenges into opportunities for growth. <br> <br>

            Collaboration is my secret sauce. I thrive in dynamic teams, where creativity sparks, and brilliant ideas collide. The more minds, the merrier! <br> <br>

            Outside the tech realm, you might catch me exploring design galaxies, debating the future of front-end at meetups, or simply sipping on a cup of inspiration from design blogs. ☕️
